## üöÄ Project Overview
This project demonstrates a full end-to-end data engineering and analytics workflow centered around NFL data.

- Data is extracted from ESPN using a combination of backend APIs, JSON data, and Selenium for dynamic web pages.
- Loaded into a MySQL database, cleaned and transformed via SQL.
- Modeled with a many-to-many Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).
- Analyzed and created insights using MySQL.
- Visualized with interactive dashboards in Tableau.

## üéØ Objectives

### Data Extraction from ESPN
- Scraped comprehensive NFL player and game data across all 18 regular-season weeks.
- Utilized Python with Selenium for dynamic webpage elements.
- Accessed ESPN‚Äôs backend API to pull JSON data for detailed game and player stats.
- Transformed and prepared extracted data for database ingestion.

### Data Cleaning and Normalization
- Loaded raw data into MySQL.
- Cleaned the data by removing duplicates, handling nulls, fixing data types, and splitting composite fields.
- Built normalized, relational tables with proper use of primary and foreign keys.
- Created many-to-many relationship tables where needed (e.g., players, games, referees).

### Data Modeling
- Developed an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to map out the database schema.
- Structured data for optimized query performance and scalability.

### Advanced SQL Analytics
- Wrote advanced SQL queries to generate insights.
- Used techniques like:
  - Window Functions (e.g., `LAG`, `ROW_NUMBER`)
  - Joins and Subqueries
  - Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
  - Unions and Data Aggregations

### Interactive Visualization
- Created professional, interactive dashboards in Tableau to showcase key findings.
- Included player performance trends, team comparisons, QB rating analysis, and more.
